## About it

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for practicing and learning Next.js.

I created this project so I could give my first steps towards frontend development.
In this project I used [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to create something similar to a pokedex app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
